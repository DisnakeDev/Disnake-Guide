# Slash Commands

A **slash command** is one of the types of client-integrated interactions a bot can create. Unlike prefix commands, these do not require the message content intent.

This section will go in-depth on the creation, types and handling of slash commands with `disnake`.

:::note

A bot needs to be authorized with the `applications.commands` scope in order to create slash commands in a guild. We recommend adding this scope to your bot invite links.

:::

## Defining slash commands

To create a slash command, use the <DocsLink ext="commands" reference="disnake.ext.commands.Bot.slash_command">@Bot.slash_command</DocsLink> decorator.

```python
@bot.slash_command(
    name="ping",
    description="Returns websocket latency.",
)
async def ping(inter: disnake.ApplicationCommandInteraction):
    ...
```

<br />
<DiscordMessages>
	<DiscordMessage profile="bot">
		<div slot="interactions">
			<DiscordInteraction profile="user" command="true">
				ping
			</DiscordInteraction>
		</div>
		Latency: <DiscordMarkdown>`42ms`</DiscordMarkdown>!
	</DiscordMessage>
</DiscordMessages>
<br />

If you're using cogs, the <DocsLink ext="commands" reference="disnake.ext.commands.slash_command">@commands.slash_command</DocsLink> decorator should be used instead.

```python
class Meta(commands.Cog):
    """Meta commands."""

    @commands.slash_command(
        name="ping",
        description="Returns websocket latency.",
    )
    async def ping(self, inter: disnake.ApplicationCommandInteraction):
        ...
```

### Parameters

While some commands can exist without arguments, most commands will need to take user input to be useful. Adding an option is as simple as defining a parameter on the callback.

Here's an example of a command with one integer option (without a description):

```python
@bot.slash_command(description="Multiplies the number by 7")
async def multiply(inter, number: int):
    await inter.response.send_message(number * 7)
```

To make a parameter optional, provide a default value for the option:

```python
@bot.slash_command(description="Multiplies the number by a multiplier")
async def multiply(inter, number: int, multiplier: int = 7):
    await inter.response.send_message(number * multiplier)
```

### Subcommands

<!----TODO---->

## Registering commands

Unlike prefix commands, slash commands must be registered with Discord first, otherwise they won't show up if you press "/".
By default, the library registers and updates your slash commands automatically.
It does so on bot start or when cogs are loaded, unloaded, or reloaded.

:::note

The library avoids unnecessary API requests during this process.
If the registered commands match the commands in your code, no API requests are made.
Otherwise only one bulk overwrite request is done.

:::

If you want to disable the automatic registration, set the `sync_commands` parameter of `commands.Bot` to `False`.
If you want to see how exactly the list of registered commands changes, set the `sync_commands_debug` parameter to `True`.

```python
bot = commands.Bot("!", sync_commands_debug=True)
```

It will print (or use the logger, if enabled) which commands were added, edited, deleted or left untouched.

### Global commands

Global slash commands are visible everywhere, including your bot DMs.
If you don't specify the `test_guilds` parameter of `commands.Bot`, all your slash commands are global by default.

Global commands are visible and usable on most devices right away.

### Guild commands

If you specify the `test_guilds` parameter of `commands.Bot`, all slash commands in your code are no longer global.
The following code will register all slash commands only in 2 guilds:

```python
bot = commands.Bot("!", test_guilds=[123456789, 987654321])  # guild IDs
```

If you want to keep some of your slash commands global and make some of them local, specify the `guild_ids` parameter of `@bot.slash_command()`:

```python
bot = commands.Bot("!")


@bot.slash_command()
async def global_command(inter):
    """This command is visible everywhere"""
    ...


@bot.slash_command(guild_ids=[123456789])
async def local_command(inter):
    """This command is visible in one guild"""
    ...
```

## Responding to commands {#responding}

### Sending responses {#response}

The <DocsLink reference="disnake.Interaction.response">response</DocsLink> attribute returns a <DocsLink reference="disnake.InteractionResponse">InteractionResponse</DocsLink>
instance that has 4 ways to respond to an ApplicationCommandInteraction.
A response can <b>only be done once</b>.
If you want to send secondary messages, consider using a <DocsLink reference="disnake.Interaction.followup">followup</DocsLink> webhook instead.

:::warning

An interaction can only be responded to **once**. After a response is made, **no more responses can be made.** See the [followup](#followup) object for sending messages after responding.
:::

1. <DocsLink reference="disnake.InteractionResponse.send_message">send_message</DocsLink> - Sends response message.
1. <DocsLink reference="disnake.InteractionResponse.edit_message">edit_message</DocsLink> - Edits original message, for example
   in component or modal interactions. Cannot be used with application commands.
1. <DocsLink reference="disnake.InteractionResponse.defer">defer</DocsLink> - Defers the interaction.
1. <DocsLink reference="disnake.InteractionResponse.send_modal">send_modal</DocsLink> - Sends a <DocsLink reference="disnake.ui.Modal">
   	Modal
   </DocsLink> as a response.

:::note

If you're going to run long processes (more than 3 seconds) before responding, you should first <DocsLink reference="disnake.InteractionResponse.defer">defer</DocsLink> the interaction,
as interactions expire after 3 seconds and later responses will fail.
Deferring an interaction response shows a loading indicator to the user, and gives you more time to prepare a complete response.
Once your response is ready, you can edit the original response using the <DocsLink reference="disnake.InteractionResponse.edit_original_message">edit_original_message</DocsLink> method.

:::

```python title="example.py"
@bot.slash_command()
async def ping(inter: ApplicationCommandInteraction):
    await inter.response.send_message("Pong!")


@bot.slash_command()
async def defer(inter: ApplicationCommandInteraction):
    await inter.response.defer()
    await asyncio.sleep(10)
    await inter.edit_original_message(content="The wait is over, my comrades!")
```

### Followups

Followups are a way to send a message after responding. There are two important restrictions for when a followup can be used:

-   The interaction must have been responded to (see [responding](#responses)).
-   The interaction must not be expired (i.e. hasn't exceeded the 15 minute limit).
    Checking if an interaction has expired can be done with <DocsLink reference="disnake.ApplicationCommandInteraction.is_expired">ApplicationCommandInteraction.is_expired</DocsLink>.

At their core, followups are simply <DocsLink reference="disnake.Webhook">Webhook</DocsLink> instances. The only special thing about them is that the `wait` parameter is treated as if it is always set to `True`.

Take this as an example of how followups could be used:

```python
@bot.slash_command()
async def timer(inter: disnake.ApplicationCommandInteraction, seconds: int):
    await inter.response.send_message(f"Setting a timer for {seconds} seconds.")
    await asyncio.sleep(seconds)
    await inter.followup.send(f"{inter.author.mention}, your timer expired!")
```

<br />
<DiscordMessages>
	<DiscordMessage profile="bot">
		<div slot="interactions">
			<DiscordInteraction profile="user" command="true">
				timer
			</DiscordInteraction>
		</div>
		Setting a timer for 30 seconds.
	</DiscordMessage>
	<DiscordMessage profile="bot">
		<div slot="interactions">
			<DiscordInteraction profile="bot">Setting a timer for 30 seconds.</DiscordInteraction>
		</div>
		<DiscordMention profile="user"></DiscordMention>, your timer expired!
	</DiscordMessage>
</DiscordMessages>
<br />
