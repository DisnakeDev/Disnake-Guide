# Slash Commands

A **slash command** is one of the types of client-integrated interactions a bot can create. Unlike prefix commands, these do not require the message content intent.

This section will go in-depth on the creation, types and handling of slash commands with `disnake`.

:::note

A bot needs to be authorized with the `applications.commands` scope in order to create slash commands in a guild.

:::

To create a slash command, you need to use the `@bot.slash_command` decorator.

```python
@bot.slash_command(
    name="ping",
    description="Returns websocket latency.",
)
async def ping(inter: disnake.ApplicationCommandInteraction):
    ...
```

<br />
<DiscordMessages>
	<DiscordMessage profile="bot">
		<div slot="interactions">
			<DiscordInteraction profile="user" command="true">
				ping
			</DiscordInteraction>
		</div>
		Pong!
	</DiscordMessage>
</DiscordMessages>
<br />

## Registering commands

Unlike prefix commands, slash commands must be registered in Discord first. Otherwise they won't pop up if you press "/".
By default, the library registers / updates your slash commands automatically.
It does so on bot start or when one or several cogs are unloaded / reloaded.

:::note

The library doesn't make unnecessary API requests during this process.
If registered commands match the commands in your code, no API requests are made.
Otherwise only one bulk overwrite request is done.

:::

If you want to disable the automatic registration, set the `sync_commands` parameter of `commands.Bot` to `False`.
If you want to see how exactly the list of registered commands changes, set the `sync_commands_debug` parameter to `True`.

```python
bot = commands.Bot("!", sync_commands_debug=True)
```

It will print which commands were added, edited, deleted or untouched. It also depends on your logging level.

### Global commands

Global slash commands are visible everywhere, including your bot DMs.
If you don't specify the `test_guilds` parameter of `commands.Bot`, all your slash commands are global.

:::note

The first registration of global commands may take up to 1 hour.
However, they show up instantly in the bot DMs.

:::

:::note

You don't have to keep your bot online this whole time. You can turn it off once `on_ready` fires.
Once all commands have appeared, they show up instantly in any new guild.

:::

### Guild commands

If you specify the `test_guilds` parameter of `commands.Bot`, all slash commands in your code are no longer global.
The following code will register all slash commands only in 2 guilds:

```python
bot = commands.Bot("!", test_guilds=[123456789, 987654321])  # guild IDs
```

If you want to keep some of your slash commands global and make some of them local, specify the `guild_ids` parameter of `@bot.slash_command()`:

```python
bot = commands.Bot("!")


@bot.slash_command()
async def global_command(inter):
    """This command is visible everywhere"""
    ...


@bot.slash_command(guild_ids=[123456789])
async def local_command(inter):
    """This command is visible in one guild"""
    ...
```

:::note

Guild commands show up instantly after registration.

## Responding to commands

### Sending responses

The <DocsLink reference="disnake.Interaction.response">response</DocsLink> attribute returns a <DocsLink reference="disnake.InteractionResponse">InteractionResponse</DocsLink> instance that has 4 usable methods. A response can <b>only be done once</b>. If you want to send secondary
messages, consider using a <DocsLink reference="disnake.Interaction.followup">followup</DocsLink> webhook instead.

<br />
<br />

1. <DocsLink reference="disnake.InteractionResponse.send_message">send_message</DocsLink> - Sends response message
2. <DocsLink reference="disnake.InteractionResponse.edit_message">edit_message</DocsLink> - Edits original message, you're
   unable to use this in application command because there are no message while you responding
3. <DocsLink reference="disnake.InteractionResponse.defer">defer</DocsLink> - Defers the interaction
4. <DocsLink reference="disnake.InteractionResponse.is_done">is_done</DocsLink> - Indicates whether an interaction response
   has been done before

:::note

<DocsLink reference="disnake.InteractionResponse.defer">defer</DocsLink> works differently depending on the type of interaction.
It creates "Bot is thinking..." message for application commands and doesn't throw "This interaction failed" if you're not
going to respond to message components.

:::

:::note

If you're going to run long processes (more than 3 seconds) while responding, you must first defer the interaction. Then
when your response is ready you can edit the message using <DocsLink reference="disnake.InteractionResponse.edit_original_message">edit_original_message</DocsLink> method.

:::

```python title="example.py"
@bot.slash_command()
async def ping(inter: ApplicationCommandInteraction):
    await inter.response.send_message("Pong!")


@bot.slash_command()
async def defer(inter: ApplicationCommandInteraction):
    await inter.response.defer()
    await asyncio.sleep(10)
    await inter.edit_original_message(content="The wait is over, my comrades!")
```

### Follow-ups

Often used when you need to send secondary messages after responding.
