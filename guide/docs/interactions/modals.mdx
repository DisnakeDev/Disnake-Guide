# Modals & Text Inputs

Modals are how you can prompt users for further detailed input. They act as client-integrated pop-ups, and work in tandem
with interactive components called [Text Inputs](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/message-components#text-inputs).
These inputs can have various forms, that can accept information from the user on prompt, and use the callback to receive
and process that information.

This section goes in-depth on using modals with other interactive components, and responding to interactions with them.

## Modal preview

Here is an example of how a modal may look. We will go over modal construction in the next part of this article.

<br />

	<img src={require('./images/modals-preview.png').default} alt="Modal preview" width="60%" />
</p>
<br />

Once the user inputs information into the modal, the bot will receive a callback that includes the values. As an example, this information has been portrayed in an embed below.

<br />
<DiscordMessages>
	<DiscordMessage author="Disnake Bot" avatar="/public/disnake-logo.png" bot="true">
		<DiscordEmbed embedTitle="Tag Creation" slot="embeds">
			<DiscordEmbedFields slot="fields">
				<DiscordEmbedField fieldTitle="Name">This is the tag's name.</DiscordEmbedField>
				<DiscordEmbedField fieldTitle="Description">
					This is the tag's description. It can be as long as 4000 characters.
				</DiscordEmbedField>
			</DiscordEmbedFields>
		</DiscordEmbed>
	</DiscordMessage>
</DiscordMessages>

This was done using the following code, in the form of a cog.

```python title="modals.py"
# At the top of the file.
import disnake
from disnake.ext import commands
from disnake.enums import TextInputStyle

# Subclassing the modal.
class MyModal(disnake.ui.Modal):
    def __init__(self):
        # The details of the modal, and its components
        components = [
            disnake.ui.TextInput(
                label="Name",
                placeholder="Foo Tag",
                custom_id="name",
                style=TextInputStyle.short,
                max_length=50,
            ),
            disnake.ui.TextInput(
                label="Description",
                placeholder="Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.",
                custom_id="description",
                style=TextInputStyle.paragraph,
            ),
        ]
        super().__init__(
            title="Create Tag",
            custom_id="create_tag",
            components=components,
        )

    # The callback received when the user input is completed.
    async def callback(self, inter: disnake.ModalInteraction):
        embed = disnake.Embed(title="Tag Creation")
        for key, value in inter.text_values.items():
            embed.add_field(
                name=key.capitalize(),
                value=value[:1024],
                inline=False,
            )
        await inter.response.send_message(embed=embed)


bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix="!")


@bot.slash_command()
async def tags(inter: disnake.AppCmdInter):
    """Sends a Modal to create a tag."""
    await inter.response.send_modal(modal=MyModal())


bot.run("YOUR_BOT_TOKEN")
```

## Creating a modal

A modal can be created and sent using two different methods, just like other message components:

-   Subclassing <DocsLink reference="disnake.ui.Modal">disnake.ui.Modal</DocsLink> to define the components, and sending it through the `modal` parameter of <DocsLink reference="disnake.InteractionResponse.send_modal">interaction.send_modal</DocsLink> (as done in the example above).
-   Defining the attributes and components of the modal inside <DocsLink reference="disnake.InteractionResponse.send_modal">interaction.send_modal</DocsLink> itself. This is considered a "lower-level" implementation of modals - we will use the same term to refer to it in this section.

A <DocsLink reference="disnake.ui.Modal">disnake.ui.Modal</DocsLink> object has the following attributes:

-   `title`: The title of the modal.
-   `custom_id`: An ID specified to the modal. This can be accessed via <DocsLink reference="disnake.ModalInteraction" />.
-   `timeout`: The time (in seconds) after which the modal is removed from cache. Defaults to **600 seconds**.
-   `components`: The list of components to be displayed in the modal. Limited to **5 action rows**.

:::caution

Modals without timeouts are not currently supported. There is no event dispatched when the modal is closed by the user, and thus the modal would not be removed from cache without a timeout.

:::

These attributes can be used while creating a modal, as follows.

```python title="modals.py"
# Subclassing the modal.
class MyModal(disnake.ui.Modal):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(
            title="Modal Title",
            custom_id="modal_id",
            timeout=300,
            components=[...],
        )


# Using the lower-level interface. (inside a function)
await inter.response.send_modal(
    title="Modal Title",
    custom_id="modal_id",
    timeout=300,
    components=[...],
)
```

## `TextInput` components

`TextInput` is a component in itself, like buttons and select menus. It is responsible for receiving user input in the form of text, and cannot be used outside of modals. It has the following customizable attributes.

-   `label`: The label of the text input.
-   `custom_id`: An ID specified to the text input.
-   `style`: Utilizes one of <DocsLink reference="disnake.TextInputStyle" /> for the component. Defaults to <DocsLink reference="disnake.TextInputStyle.short">short</DocsLink>.
-   `placeholder`: The placeholder text that is shown if nothing is entered.
-   `value`: The pre-filled value of the text input (up to `max_length`).
-   `required`: Whether the text input is required. Defaults to `True`.
-   `min_length` and `max_length`: Set the minimum and maximum length of the inputs respectively.

These attributes can be used per `TextInput` component, as follows.

```python title="textinput.py"
disnake.ui.TextInput(
    label="Name",
    placeholder="Foo Tag",
    custom_id="name",
    style=TextInputStyle.short,
    max_length=50,
)
```

The <DocsLink reference="disnake.TextInputStyle" /> attribute currently has two styles, which have multiple aliases:

-   `short` - Represents a single-line text input component. Also called `single_line`.
-   `long` - Represents a multi-line text input component. Also called `multi_line` or `paragraph`.

## Modal events

### <DocsLink reference="disnake.ui.Modal.callback">`callback`</DocsLink>

### <DocsLink reference="disnake.ui.Modal.on_error">`on_error`</DocsLink>

### <DocsLink reference="disnake.ui.Modal.on_timeout">`on_timeout`</DocsLink>

## Modal notes

-   The <DocsLink reference="disnake.TextInputStyle" /> defaults to `short`, if not specified for the component.
-   All <DocsLink reference="disnake.ui.TextInput">TextInput</DocsLink> components are required by default.

## Modal limits

-   A modal can have a total of **5 action rows**.
-   The `placeholder` has a maximum value of **100 characters**.
-   The `custom_id` has a maximum value of **100 characters**, for both modals and text inputs.
-   The pre-defined `value` has a maximum length of **4000 characters** (overriden by the developer-defined limit).
-   The minimum and maximum values of a text input can be set from **0-4000 characters** and **1-4000 characters** respectively.
