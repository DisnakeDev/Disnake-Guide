# Interaction Modals

Modals are how you can prompt users for further detailed input. They act as client-integrated pop-ups, and work in tandem
with interactive components called ["Text Inputs"](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/message-components#text-inputs).
These inputs can have various forms, that can accept information from the user on prompt, and use the callback to receive
and process that information.

This section goes in-depth on using modals with other interactive components, and responding to interactions with them.
