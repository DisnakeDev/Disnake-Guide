# Creating cogs/extensions

[**Cogs**](https://docs.disnake.dev/en/latest/ext/commands/cogs.html) are analogous to modules that extend the core of
the bot - thus adding to its functions and abilities. They also allow you to break down and organize your bot's
collection of commands/listeners (which is useful when your bot's command list becomes quite extensive).

:::note

Cogs are typically used alongside with **Extensions**. You can read more about them
[in the documentation](https://docs.disnake.dev/en/latest/ext/commands/extensions.html).

:::

## Creating files

What we code here will extend on the code from [**Initial Files**](./initial-files.mdx), and thus we assume that there
already exists a `main.py` file in your directory with initiates a `commands.Bot()` instance.

```python title="main.py"
import disnake
from disnake.ext import commands

bot = commands.Bot()


@bot.event
async def on_ready():
    print("The bot is ready!")


bot.run("YOUR_BOT_TOKEN")
```

Next, we will create a new Python file either in the same directory as `main.py` or in a subfolder (which is
recommended). For the sake of being organized, we will create the cog file in a separate `cogs` folder, and name the
file `ping.py` just for the "ping" command. If you're strictly following the guide, your file directory should look
something like this:

```
.
├── cogs/
│   └── ping.py
├── main.py
└── secrets.env
```

## Initial code

### Inheriting a class

The first step is to create a class in `ping.py` that inherits from the `commands.Cog`, along with a constructor that
takes in the `bot` object as its only argument and saves it. This is where we will be putting in our commands.

```python title="ping.py"
from disnake.ext import commands


class PingCommand(commands.Cog):
    """This will be for a ping command."""

    def __init__(self, bot: commands.Bot):
        self.bot = bot
```

:::tip

We typehint `bot: commands.Bot` here to give the IDE an idea of what the argument type is. It is not necessary, but can
be useful in development when adding certain arguments to your commands.

:::

### Registering commands

Now, to define a slash command inside the class, we will use the `commands.slash_command()` decorator. It functions the same as
`bot.slash_command()`, but works in cogs as well.

```python title="ping.py" {10-13}
from disnake.ext import commands


class PingCommand(commands.Cog):
    """This will be for a ping command."""

    def __init__(self, bot: commands.Bot):
        self.bot = bot

    @commands.slash_command()
    async def ping(self, inter: disnake.ApplicationCommandInteraction):
        """Get the bot's current websocket latency."""
        await inter.response.send_message(f"Pong! {round(self.bot.latency * 1000)}ms")
```

Note that we're using `self` as the first argument, since the command function is inside a class.

### Adding `setup` function

The last thing that needs to be added to this file is a `setup` function, so that disnake can load the cog when it is
added to `main.py`.

```python title="ping.py" {16,17}
from disnake.ext import commands


class PingCommand(commands.Cog):
    """This will be for a ping command."""

    def __init__(self, bot: commands.Bot):
        self.bot = bot

    @commands.slash_command()
    async def ping(self, inter: disnake.ApplicationCommandInteraction):
        """Get the bot's current websocket latency."""
        await inter.response.send_message(f"Pong! {round(self.bot.latency * 1000)}ms")


def setup(bot: commands.Bot):
    bot.add_cog(PingCommand(bot))
```

This cog file can now be added to the bot via the `bot.load_extension()` method in `main.py`.

```python title="main.py"
import disnake
from disnake.ext import commands

bot = commands.Bot()


@bot.event
async def on_ready():
    print("The bot is ready!")


bot.load_extension("cogs.ping")  # Note: We did not append the .py extension.

bot.run("YOUR_BOT_TOKEN")
```

Note that we've input `"cogs.ping"` here, since the `ping.py` file is inside the `cogs` folder. Therefore, the basic
syntax for loading an extension is `bot.load_extension("<folder_name>.<file_name>")`.

And that concludes the use of cogs with `disnake`! You can now create multiple cogs to group and organize your
commands/events, and load/unload them via your main file. More information on special cog methods and meta options can
be found [in the documentation](https://docs.disnake.dev/en/latest/ext/commands/cogs.html).

## Syntax changes

Cogs represent a fairly drastic change in the way you write commands and bots, so here's a list you can come back to for
the primary syntax used in cogs:

-   Each cog is a Python class that subclasses <DocsLink ext="commands" reference="disnake.ext.commands.Cog">commands.Cog</DocsLink>.
-   Decorators for commands in cogs:
    -   Command - <DocsLink ext="commands" reference="disnake.ext.commands.command">commands.command()</DocsLink>
    -   Slash command - <DocsLink ext="commands" reference="disnake.ext.commands.slash_command">commands.slash_command()</DocsLink>
    -   User command - <DocsLink ext="commands" reference="disnake.ext.commands.user_command">commands.user_command()</DocsLink>
    -   Message command - <DocsLink ext="commands" reference="disnake.ext.commands.message_command">commands.message_command()</DocsLink>
-   Every listener is marked with the <DocsLink ext="commands" reference="disnake.ext.commands.Cog.listener">commands.Cog.listener()</DocsLink> decorator.
-   Cogs are then registered with the <DocsLink ext="commands" reference="disnake.ext.commands.Bot.add_cog">Bot.add_cog</DocsLink> call, and are subsequently removed with the <DocsLink ext="commands" reference="disnake.ext.commands.Bot.remove_cog">Bot.remove_cog</DocsLink> call.

Cogs represent a fairly drastic change in the way you write commands and bots. Thus, it is recommended that you get
familiar with this syntax - since the code we use in this section is largely tailored for cogs.
