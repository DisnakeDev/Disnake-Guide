# Contributing

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute. This guide uses [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) for building the guide itself, and [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) for various formatting/cleanup tasks, like formatting Python codeblocks. Make sure to install their respective CLIs, as they're utilized by our `npm` scripts.

## Prerequisites

-   node v16 or newer
-   pre-commit

## Local development

Clone the repo to your desired folder, and `cd` into it.

```
git clone https://github.com/DisnakeDev/guide.git
cd guide/guide
```

Further, install the dependencies using `npm install`.

### Starting the server

To build and serve a preview of your site locally, run the following commands while in root:

```
cd guide
npm run start
```

This will serve the site on `http://localhost:3000/`. To specify the port of the devserver, you can use the `--port` option.

```
npm run start -- --port=8000
```

## Linting

Linting your edits/additions is critical to ensure the consistency of the material with the rest of the guide.

## Using components

### `<DocsLink />`

### `<ResultingCode />`

### `<WorkInProgress />`

## Commit convention
