# Threads

Threads are <DocsLink reference="disnake.abc.Messageable">Messageable</DocsLink> objects, and can be thought of as
sub-channels inside existing channels. They allow organization of multiple topics in a channel by temporarily giving
them a separate space.

## Thread-related methods

### Creating and deleting threads

A thread can be created by using the <DocsLink reference="disnake.TextChannel.create_thread">create_thread()</DocsLink>
method on a <DocsLink reference="disnake.Message">Message</DocsLink> or <DocsLink reference="disnake.TextChannel">TextChannel</DocsLink> object.

```python title="threads.py"
# Using the 'Message' object
message = channel.fetch_message(1234567890)
await message.create_thread(
    name="This message will act as the thread's starting message.",
    auto_archive_duration=60,
)

# Using the 'TextChannel' object
channel = bot.get_channel(...)
await channel.create_thread(
    name="This thread requires a starting message to be specified.",
    auto_archive_duration=60,
    message=message,
)
```

In order to delete a thread, you can use the <DocsLink reference="disnake.Thread.delete">delete()</DocsLink> method on
the <DocsLink reference="disnake.Thread">Thread</DocsLink> object.

```python title="threads.py"
thread = channel.get_thread(...)  # You can also use bot.get_channel(...)

await thread.delete()
```

### Joining and leaving threads

Both joining and leaving a thread require you to have a <DocsLink reference="disnake.Thread">Thread</DocsLink> object,
on which you can use the <DocsLink reference="disnake.Thread.join">join()</DocsLink> and <DocsLink reference="disnake.Thread.leave">leave()</DocsLink> methods for the respective action.

```python title="threads.py"
thread = channel.get_thread(...)  # You can also use bot.get_channel(...)

# Joining a thread.
await thread.join()

# Leaving a thread.
await thread.leave()
```

It is recommended to use a `try-except` loop here, in case that the thread is not joinable by the bot user; this can be
due to missing permissions.

### Archiving, unarchiving and locking threads

Archiving a thread essentially makes it "read-only" for non-moderators - where they can view older messages, but not
send messages themselves. Locked threads can only be unarchived by users who have the `manage_threads` permission.

Threads have an **auto-archive duration** - a period of time after which the thread is archived automatically without
being configured by a moderator. This duration can also be set by a bot user while creating or editing a thread.

```python title="threads.py"
thread = channel.get_thread(...)

await thread.edit(auto_archive_duration=60)
```

Configuring a thread to be archived, unarchived or locked can be done using the <DocsLink reference="disnake.Thread.edit">edit()</DocsLink> method, via the `archived` and `locked` parameters. Both of
these attributes accept a boolean value.

```python title="threads.py"
thread = channel.get_thread(...)

# Archiving a thread
await thread.edit(archived=True)  # Set to 'False', to unarchive the thread

# Locking a thread
await thread.edit(locked=True)
```

### Public and private threads

Public threads are accessible to all members that can view the thread's parent channel. Such threads can be created
using the <DocsLink reference="disnake.TextChannel.create_thread">create_thread()</DocsLink> method, as covered in
[a previous section](#creating-and-deleting-threads).

Private threads are those which are only accessible to moderators and the members invited by the thread creator. A
private thread can be created by specifying the `type` in the <DocsLink reference="disnake.TextChannel">create_thread()</DocsLink> method as <DocsLink reference="disnake.ChannelType.private_thread">private_thread</DocsLink>.

```python title="threads.py" {6}
channel = bot.get_channel(...)

await channel.create_thread(
    name="Thread Title",
    auto_archive_duration=60,
    type=disnake.ChannelType.private_thread,
)
```

:::note

A private thread can only be created on a <DocsLink reference="disnake.TextChannel">TextChannel</DocsLink> object. The
type that can be specified under <DocsLink reference="disnake.TextChannel.create_thread">create_thread()</DocsLink> can
be `public_thread`, `private_thread` or `news_thread`.
