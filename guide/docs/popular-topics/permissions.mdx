# Permissions

Permissions are one of the key concepts in Discord. As the name implies, they can be used to grant or revoke
access to certain actions for certain users based on the roles they have and the channel they're in.

In disnake, permissions are controlled via two objects: <DocsLink reference="disnake.Permissions" /> and <DocsLink reference="disnake.PermissionOverwrite" />, which we'll discuss below.

## Creating permission objects

`Permissions` can be constructed in two ways: using manual instantiation with granted/revoked permissions specified via
keyword arguments, or shorthand methods that create permission objects with specific groups of permissions.

:::note
There's actually a third option: specifying the raw value, but it's usage is generally discouraged as it's hard
to understand at a glance what the result will be. Anyway, here's how you do it:

```python
permissions = disnake.Permissions(64)  # Grants the "Add Reactions" permission.

assert permissions.value == 64
```

:::

### Manual creation

Manual creation is usually preferred over shorthand methods due to the flexibility it provides while also still being
as intuitive as possible, and, as such, is also what you'll usually encounter in other examples and documentation.

```python
permissions = disnake.Permissions(
    # Each permission is specified using a keyword argument,
    # where value of `True` means that it is granted, while
    # `False` revokes the permission.
    view_audit_log=True,  # This grants the "View Audit Log" permission.
    add_reactions=False,  # This revokes the "Add Reactions" permission.
    # Note that not all permission names are the same as in the
    # official UI. For example, in the UI guilds are called "Servers",
    # and, as such, the `manage_guild` kwarg is actually responsible
    # for controlling the "Manage Server" permission.
    manage_guild=False,  # Revokes the "Manage Server" permission.
    use_voice_activation=True,  # Grants the "Use Voice Activity" permission.
    # There are also a few aliases for certain permissions.
    manage_permissions=True,  # Grants the "Manage Roles" permission.
    manage_roles=False,  # Revokes the "Manage Roles" permission.
)
```

Note that, quoting from docs, "Arguments are applied in order, which notably also means that supplying a flag and
its alias will make whatever comes last overwrite the first one". As an example, in the above case the latter
`manage_roles=False` argument will overwrite the `manage_permissions` one, and the resulting object will have
both of them set to `False` (since they represent the same permission).

```python
assert not permissions.manage_roles
assert not permissions.manage_permissions
```

### Shorthand methods

Sometimes you may want to grant a group of permissions, like the ones defined in the official UI. Manually creating
them can become tedious, and you'll also need to keep them up-to-date with the UI. Luckily, disnake already does that
for you via a range of methods defined on the <DocsLink reference="disnake.Permissions" /> class.

```python
# All permissions grouped under "Advanced" in the official UI.
advanced_permissions = disnake.Permissions.advanced()
# ALL permissions granted, including advanced ones.
all_permissions = disnake.Permissions.all()
```

To not duplicate what's already said in <DocsLink reference="disnake.Permissions">docs</DocsLink>, we'll only
list the available methods here:

-   <DocsLink reference="disnake.Permissions.advanced" />
-   <DocsLink reference="disnake.Permissions.all" />
-   <DocsLink reference="disnake.Permissions.all_channel" />
-   <DocsLink reference="disnake.Permissions.events" />
-   <DocsLink reference="disnake.Permissions.general" />
-   <DocsLink reference="disnake.Permissions.membership" />
-   <DocsLink reference="disnake.Permissions.none" />
-   <DocsLink reference="disnake.Permissions.private_channel" />
-   <DocsLink reference="disnake.Permissions.stage" />
-   <DocsLink reference="disnake.Permissions.stage_moderator" />
-   <DocsLink reference="disnake.Permissions.text" />
-   <DocsLink reference="disnake.Permissions.voice" />

## Permission Overwrites

<!-- NOTE: The #untouched-permissions anchor is placed a bit above the paragraph to account for website header offset
This likely won't work for all possible screen/window sizes, but it's better than nothing. -->

A <DocsLink reference="disnake.PermissionOverwrite" /> is an override for server-wide permissions (i.e., those granted
by roles). Permission overwrites are assigned per-channel and to a specific user/role, and are made up of two <span id="untouched-permissions">`Permissions`</span>
objects: the one containing allowed permissions, and the one contaning denied permissions, collectively called a "pair".

If some permission is not explicitly allowed neither denied, then it is considered "untouched" and is not overriden. The value of an
untouched permission is `None`.

```python
overwrite = disnake.PermissionOverwrite(
    add_reactions=True,  # This goes into the "Allowed" part.
    view_audit_log=False,  # This goes into the "Denied" part.
    manage_guild=None,  # Effectively a no-op as `None` is the default value.
)

# disnake allows you to query individual permissions just as easily
# as with regular `Permissions`.

assert overwrite.add_reactions
assert not overwrite.view_audit_log
assert overwrite.manage_guild is None

# Although not recommended, you can still access raw objects if neccesary
# using `.pair()`, which returns a tuple of two `Permissions` objects,
# first having the allowed permissions set to `True` and second having
# the denied ones set to `True`.

allow, deny = overwrite.pair()
assert allow == disnake.Permissions(add_reactions=True)
assert deny == disnake.Permissions(view_audit_log=False)
```

You can update overwrites in-place by simply assigning values to attributes or by using
the <DocsLink reference="disnake.PermissionOverwrite.update" /> method.

```python
overwrite.view_audit_log = True

assert overwrite.view_audit_log

overwrite.update(view_audit_log=False)

assert not overwrite.view_audit_log
```

If you need to create a new overwrite object based on an existing one, you can do the following.

```python
allow, deny = overwrite.pair()
new_overwrite = disnake.PermissionOverwrite.from_pair(allow, deny)

new_overwrite.add_reactions = False

assert not new_overwrite.add_reactions
```

## Using permissions

Creating a "chat moderator" role:

```python
permissions = disnake.Permissions(
    manage_messages=True,
    moderate_members=True,
)

chatmod_role = await guild.create_role(
    name="Chat Moderator",
    permissions=permissions,
    hoist=True,
)
```

Creating an `#only-mods` <DocsLink reference="disnake.TextChannel"/>:

```python
# Allow mods to see the channel
overwrite = disnake.PermissionOverwrite(view_channel=True)
# See `TextChannel.edit()` documentation.
mapping = {chatmod_role: overwrite}

only_mods_channel = await guild.create_text_channel("only-mods", overwrites=mapping)

assert not only_mods_channel.permissions_for(guild.default_role).view_channel
assert only_mods_channel.permissions_for(chatmod_role).view_channel
```

A slash command that checks whether the command author can add reactions in the current channel:

```python
@commands.slash_command(description="Checks whether you can add reactions!")
async def can_add_reactions(inter: disnake.ApplicationCommandInteraction) -> None:
    await inter.send("Sure you can!" if inter.permissions.add_reactions else "Sadly no :(")
```

## Querying permissions

There are various ways to query permission information, and they also depend on the context you're
in. This section tries to list all possible methods for getting permission info, grouped by context
they can be used in.

### Context-agnostic

If you have an instance of any class implementing <DocsLink reference="disnake.abc.GuildChannel" />,
then the easiest way to query permissions for a member/role is
through <DocsLink reference="disnake.abc.GuildChannel.permissions_for" />.
This also works with <DocsLink reference="disnake.Thread" />s.
If you need a bit more lower level control, you can also get raw overwrite objects
using <DocsLink reference="disnake.abc.GuildChannel.overwrites_for" />
or <DocsLink reference="disnake.abc.GuildChannel.overwrites" />.

### In prefix commands

There are no direct methods on <DocsLink reference="disnake.ext.commands.Context" /> for querying permission
information, however, you can still access <DocsLink reference="disnake.ext.commands.Context.channel" /> and
call above-mentioned methods on it, though be sure to check that it's not <DocsLink reference="disnake.PartialMessageable" />
as it doesn't have any permissions-related methods on it either.

### In interactions

When working with interactions (i.e., with application commands or components), there are two main properties
defined on <DocsLink reference="disnake.Interaction" />: <DocsLink reference="disnake.Interaction.permissions" />
(for getting the interaction author's permissions in the current channel) and <DocsLink reference="disnake.Interaction.app_permissions" />
(for getting the bot's permissions).

## How permissions are calculated

Permissions can be a tough thing to understand at first, but understanding how permissions are
applied can help you <!-- feel the pain of us mere mortals re-implementing discord client's obscure behaviour -->
better grasp this concept.

In case we're calculating permissions for a member, the strategy is as follows:

1.  If member is the guild owner, all permissions are granted - no questions asked. Otherwise..

2.  First we apply the `@everyone` role's permissions.

3.  Then, for each role the member has we apply it's permissions too.

4.  If at this point the member has the "Administrator" permission, all others are granted automatically
    (the member is a guild-wide administrator, and, as such, is functionally equivalent to the owner except
    they can't delete the guild).

5.  After that, if we're in a channel, the following is additionally done.

6.  1.  We apply it's overwrites in the same order: `@everyone` overwrites,
        role overwrites and finally member overwrites.

    2.  Then [channel-specific implicit permissions](#channel-specific-implicit-permissions) are handled.

7.  In the end, we take into account [guild-wide implicit permissions](#guild-wide-implicit-permissions).

In case of calculating permissions for a role, the strategy is the same as if we were calculating permissions
for a member with only that role (and `@everyone`), except that member overwrites are
not taken into account.

Curious about the implementation? At the time of writing, implementation could be found
[here](https://git.disnake.dev/disnake/blob/0c193b53922002396ffbbe03d8a10b1a41c37e8e/disnake/abc.py#L651-L808).

### Implicit permissions

In Discord, there are some permissions that, when revoked, basically make it impossible to utilize other
granted permissions. For example, take a user with two permissions: "View Channel" and
"Send Messages". If at some point user loses the "View Channel" permission, it wouldn't matter whether
they can send messages in that channel: they just can't see the channel in the UI. disnake's permission system
attempts to handle such cases via "implicit permissions" - permissions that, when granted or, more commonly,
revoked, automatically grant (revoke) other permissions as well. A few handled cases are demonstrated below,
but note that this is by no means an exhaustive list: quoting from the [official Discord documentation], "in
all cases, these are based on logical conclusions about how a user with certain permissions should or should
not interact with Discord", and, as such, it's hardly possible to accomodate all possibilities.

[official discord documentation]: https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/permissions#implicit-permissions

#### Guild-wide implicit permissions

1. Timed out members are spectators.

This rule automatically revokes all permissions for timed out members _except_ "View Channel" and
"Read Message History", which are left [untouched](#untouched-permissions).

#### Channel-specific implicit permissions

1. If you can't send a message in a channel, then you can't sent _any_ message in it.

This rule automatically revokes "Send TTS Messages", "Send Voice Messages", "Mention Everyone", "Embed Links"
and "Attach Files" permissions, if the member doesn't have the "Send Messages" permission.

2. If you can't view a channel, they you can't do anything in it.

This rule automatically revokes "All Channel" permissions, as specified by <DocsLink reference="disnake.Permissions.all_channel" />,
if the member doesn't have the "View Channel" permission.

3. If you can't connect to a vocal channel, then you can't interfere with it's participants.

This rule automatically revokes "Voice", "Text" and "Stage" permission groups from the official Discord UI if
the member doesn't have the "Connect" permission.

## Operating on permission values

Since disnake v2.6, it is possible to do various operations on permission objects with minimal effort. While
not something you'd usually use often, they can come in very handy when it comes to complex permission
math you'd have to do manually otherwise.

This section is meant as a companion to the <DocsLink reference="disnake.Permissions">official reference</DocsLink>,
meaning that ideally you should read both.

The following variables will be used throughout in the examples below.

```python
base = disnake.Permissions(add_reactions=True, manage_guild=True)
same = disnake.Permissions(add_reactions=True, manage_guild=True)
superset = disnake.Permissions(add_reactions=True, manage_guild=True, send_messages=True)
subset = disnake.Permissions(add_reactions=True)
different = disnake.Permissions(use_voice_activation=True)
```

### Basic

These are operations that usually require no explanation. In any way, comments will guide you through.

```python
# Check that two permission object have same permissions set to the same value.
assert base == same
# Check that one (base) permission object has at least all of the granted permissions
# of the second one granted too.
assert base >= same
# Check that one (base) permission object has all of the granted permissions
# of the second one granted too, plus at least one extra.
assert base > subset
# Check that one (base) permission object has at maximum all of the granted permissions
# of the second one granted.
assert base <= same
# Check that one (base) permission object has at maximum of the granted permissions
# of the second one granted, minus one or more.
assert base < superset
# Check that one (base) permission object has at least one permission allowed
# that is denied in the second one (and the other way around).
assert base != different
```

### Advanced

If you're familar with bit operators in Python, then you'll feel right at home. Otherwise, read
the comments to understand what does what.

```python
# Creates a new Permissions object with all granted permissions from either one of them.
assert subset | different == disnake.Permissions(add_reactions=True, use_voice_activation=True)
# Creates a new Permissions object with only permissions granted on both.
assert base & subset == disnake.Permissions(add_reactions=True)
# Creates a new Permissions object with only permissions granted on one of base or different,
# but not both.
assert base ^ different

# Notably, all of operators above support in-place updates using the `OP=` syntax, like so:
# `base &= subset`.

# Creates a new Permissions object with all permissions from subset inverted.
assert not (~subset).add_reactions and (~subset).manage_guild
# Creates a new Permissions object with all permissions except add_reactions granted.
assert not (~disnake.Permissions.add_reactions).add_reactions
# Creates a new Permissions object with all specified permissions granted.
assert disnake.Permissions.add_reactions | disnake.Permissions.manage_guild == base
assert subset | disnake.Permissions.manage_guild == base
```

### Additional

There's also a few additional operations supported that do not involve operators.

```python
# Returns the permissions's hash. Allows permission objects to be used as dictionary keys.
hash(base)

# Permissions and PermissionOverwrite both implement `__iter__()`, and thus can be used in for loops.
truthy = []

for perm, value in base:
    if value:
        truthy.append(perm)

assert truthy == ["add_reactions", "manage_guild"]
```
