# General

General questions regarding library usage belong here.

:::note

This is placeholder content that has been taken directly from the [documentation](https://docs.disnake.dev/en/latest/), and inherited from `discord.py`. This section will most likely be rewritten in the future.

:::

### Where can I find usage examples?

Example code can be found in the [examples folder](https://github.com/DisnakeDev/disnake/tree/master/examples) in the repository.

### How do I set the "Playing" status?

The `activity` keyword argument may be passed in the <DocsLink reference="disnake.Client" /> constructor or <DocsLink reference="disnake.Client.change_presence" />, given an <DocsLink reference="disnake.Activity" /> object.

The constructor may be used for static activities, while <DocsLink reference="disnake.Client.change_presence" /> may be used to update the activity at runtime.

:::warning

It is highly discouraged to use <DocsLink reference="disnake.Client.change_presence" /> or API calls in <DocsLink reference="disnake.on_ready" /> as this event may be called many times while running, not just once. There is a high chance of disconnecting if presences are changed right after connecting.

:::

The status type (playing, listening, streaming, watching) can be set using the <DocsLink reference="disnake.ActivityType" /> enum.
For memory optimisation purposes, some activities are offered in slimmed-down versions:

-   <DocsLink reference="disnake.Game" />
-   <DocsLink reference="disnake.Streaming" />

Putting both of these pieces of info together, you get the following:

```python
client = disnake.Client(activity=disnake.Game(name="My game"))

# Or, for watching:
activity = disnake.Activity(
    name="My activity",
    type=disnake.ActivityType.watching,
)
client = disnake.Client(activity=activity)
```

### How do I send a message to a specific channel?

You must fetch the channel directly and then call the appropriate method. Example:

```python
channel = client.get_channel(12324234183172)
await channel.send("hello")
```

### How do I send a DM?

Get the <DocsLink reference="disnake.User" /> or <DocsLink reference="disnake.Member" /> object and call <DocsLink reference="disnake.abc.Messageable.send" />. For example:

```python
user = client.get_user(381870129706958858)
await user.send("üëÄ")
```

If you are responding to an event, such as <DocsLink reference="disnake.on_message" />, you already have the <DocsLink reference="disnake.User" /> object via <DocsLink reference="disnake.Message.author" />:

```python
await message.author.send("üëã")
```

### How do I get the ID of a sent message?

The <DocsLink reference="disnake.abc.Messageable.send" /> method returns the <DocsLink reference="disnake.Message" /> that was sent.
The ID of a message can be accessed via <DocsLink reference="disnake.Message.id" />:

```python
message = await channel.send("hmm‚Ä¶")
message_id = message.id
```

### How do I upload an image?

To upload something to Discord you have to use the <DocsLink reference="disnake.File" /> object.

A <DocsLink reference="disnake.File" /> accepts two parameters, the file-like object (or file path) and the filename
to pass to Discord when uploading.

If you want to upload an image it's as simple as:

```python
await channel.send(file=disnake.File("my_file.png"))
```

If you have a file-like object you can do as follows:

```python
with open("my_file.png", "rb") as fp:
    await channel.send(file=disnake.File(fp, "new_filename.png"))
```

To upload multiple files, you can use the `files` keyword argument instead of `file`:

```python
my_files = [
    disnake.File("result.zip"),
    disnake.File("teaser_graph.png"),
]
await channel.send(files=my_files)
```

If you want to upload something from a URL, you will have to use an HTTP request using [`aiohttp`](https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/index.html)
and then pass an [io.BytesIO](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.BytesIO) instance
to <DocsLink reference="disnake.File" /> like so:

```python
import io
import aiohttp

async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
    async with session.get(my_url) as resp:
        if resp.status != 200:
            return await channel.send("Could not download file...")
        data = io.BytesIO(await resp.read())
        await channel.send(file=disnake.File(data, "cool_image.png"))
```

### How can I add a reaction to a message?

You use the <DocsLink reference="disnake.Message.add_reaction" /> method.

If you want to use unicode emoji, you must pass a valid unicode code point in a string. In your code, you can write this in a few different ways:

-   `'üëç'`
-   `'\U0001F44D'`
-   `'\N{THUMBS UP SIGN}'`

Quick example:

```python
emoji = "\N{THUMBS UP SIGN}"
# or '\U0001f44d' or 'üëç'
await message.add_reaction(emoji)
```

In case you want to use emoji that come from a message, you already get their code points in the content without needing
to do anything special. You **cannot** send `':thumbsup:'` style shorthands.

For custom emoji, you should pass an instance of <DocsLink reference="disnake.Emoji" />. You can also pass a `'<:name:id>'` string, but if you
can use said emoji, you should be able to use <DocsLink reference="disnake.Client.get_emoji" /> to get an emoji via ID or use <DocsLink reference="disnake.utils.find" />
or <DocsLink reference="disnake.utils.get" /> on <DocsLink reference="disnake.Client.emojis" /> or <DocsLink reference="disnake.Guild.emojis" /> collections.

The name and ID of a custom emoji can be found with the client by prefixing `:custom_emoji:` with a backslash.
For example, sending the message `\:python3:` with the client will result in `<:python3:232720527448342530>`.

Quick example:

```python
# If you have the ID already
emoji = client.get_emoji(310177266011340803)
await message.add_reaction(emoji)

# No ID, do a lookup
emoji = disnake.utils.get(guild.emojis, name="LUL")
if emoji:
    await message.add_reaction(emoji)

# If you have the name and ID of a custom emoji:
emoji = "<:python3:232720527448342530>"
await message.add_reaction(emoji)
```

### How do I pass a coroutine to the player's "after" function?

The library's music player launches on a separate thread, ergo it does not execute inside a coroutine.
This does not mean that it is not possible to call a coroutine in the `after` parameter. To do so you must pass a callable
that wraps up a couple of aspects.

The first gotcha that you must be aware of is that calling a coroutine is not a thread-safe operation. Since we are
technically in another thread, we must take caution in calling thread-safe operations so things do not bug out. Luckily for
us, [`asyncio`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html#module-asyncio) comes with a [`asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe) function that allows us to call
a coroutine from another thread.

However, this function returns a [`Future`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#concurrent.futures.Future) and to actually call it we have to fetch its result. Putting all of
this together we can do the following:

```python
def my_after(error):
    coro = some_channel.send("Song is done!")
    fut = asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(coro, client.loop)
    try:
        fut.result()
    except:
        # An error happened sending the message
        pass


voice.play(disnake.FFmpegPCMAudio(url), after=my_after)
```

### How do I run something in the background?

Check the [`background_task.py` example](https://github.com/DisnakeDev/disnake/blob/master/examples/background_task.py).

### How do I get a specific model?

There are multiple ways of doing this. If you have a specific model's ID then you can use
one of the following functions:

-   <DocsLink reference="disnake.Client.get_channel" />
-   <DocsLink reference="disnake.Client.get_guild" />
-   <DocsLink reference="disnake.Client.get_user" />
-   <DocsLink reference="disnake.Client.get_emoji" />
-   <DocsLink reference="disnake.Client.get_member" />
-   <DocsLink reference="disnake.Client.get_channel" />
-   <DocsLink reference="disnake.Client.get_role" />

The following use an HTTP request:

-   <DocsLink reference="disnake.abc.Messageable.fetch_message" />
-   <DocsLink reference="disnake.Client.fetch_user" />
-   <DocsLink reference="disnake.Client.fetch_guilds" />
-   <DocsLink reference="disnake.Client.fetch_guild" />
-   <DocsLink reference="disnake.Client.fetch_emojis" />
-   <DocsLink reference="disnake.Client.fetch_emoji" />
-   <DocsLink reference="disnake.Client.fetch_member" />

If the functions above do not help you, then use of <DocsLink reference="disnake.utils.find" /> or <DocsLink reference="disnake.utils.get" /> would serve some use in finding
specific models.

Quick example:

```python
# Find a guild by name
guild = disnake.utils.get(client.guilds, name="My Server")

# Make sure to check if it's found
if guild is not None:
    # Find a channel by name
    channel = disnake.utils.get(guild.text_channels, name="cool-channel")
```

### How do I make a web request?

To make a request, you should use a non-blocking library.
This library already uses and requires a 3rd party library for making requests, [`aiohttp`](https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/index.html).

Quick example:

```python
async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
    async with session.get("http://aws.random.cat/meow") as r:
        if r.status == 200:
            js = await r.json()
```

See [`aiohttp`'s full documentation](http://aiohttp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for more information.

### How do I use a local image file for an embed image?

Setting a local image for the embed can be done using the `file` argument of <DocsLink reference="disnake.Embed.set_image" /> method. It accepts a <DocsLink reference="disnake.File" /> object.

Quick example:

```python
embed = disnake.Embed()
embed.set_image(file=disnake.File("path/to/file.png"))
await channel.send(embed=embed)
```

### Is there an event for audit log entries being created?

Since Discord does not dispatch this information in the gateway, the library cannot provide this information.
This is currently a Discord limitation.
