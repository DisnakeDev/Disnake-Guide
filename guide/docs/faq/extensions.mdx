# Extensions

Questions regarding `disnake.ext.commands` and `disnake.ext.tasks` belong here.

### Why does `on_message` make my commands stop working?

Overriding the default provided `on_message` forbids any extra commands from running. To fix this, add a
`bot.process_commands(message)` line at the end of your `on_message`. For example:

```python
@bot.event
async def on_message(message):
    # Do some extra stuff here

    await bot.process_commands(message)
```

Alternatively, you can place your `on_message` logic into a **listener**. In this setup, you should not
manually call `bot.process_commands()`. This also allows you to do multiple things asynchronously in response
to a message. Example:

```python
@bot.listen("on_message")
async def whatever_you_want_to_call_it(message):
    await do_stuff_here()
    # Do not process commands here
```

### Why do my arguments require quotes?

In a simple command defined as:

```python
@bot.command()
async def echo(ctx, message: str):
    await ctx.send(message)
```

Calling it via `?echo a b c` will only fetch the first argument and disregard the rest. To fix this you should either call
it via `?echo "a b c"` or change the signature to have "consume rest" behaviour. Example:

```python
@bot.command()
async def echo(ctx, *, message: str):
    await ctx.send(message)
```

This will allow you to use `?echo a b c` without needing the quotes.

### How do I get the original `message`?

The <DocsLink ext="commands" reference="disnake.ext.commands.Context" /> contains an attribute, <DocsLink ext="commands" reference="disnake.ext.commands.Context.message">message</DocsLink> to get the original
message.

Example:

```python
@bot.command()
async def length(ctx):
    await ctx.send(f"Your message is {len(ctx.message.content)} characters long.")
```

### How do I make a subcommand?

Use the <DocsLink ext="commands" reference="disnake.ext.commands.group">group()</DocsLink> decorator. This will transform the callback into a <DocsLink ext="commands" reference="disnake.ext.commands.Group" /> which will allow you to add commands into
the group operating as "subcommands". These groups can be arbitrarily nested as well.

Example:

```python
@bot.group()
async def git(ctx):
    if ctx.invoked_subcommand is None:
        await ctx.send("Invalid git command passed...")


@git.command()
async def push(ctx, remote: str, branch: str):
    await ctx.send(f"Pushing to {remote} {branch}.")
```

This could then be used as `?git push origin master`.
