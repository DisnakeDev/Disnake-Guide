# Introduction

Hello there! The purpose of this guide is to make your journey with `disnake` easier. `disnake` is a fork of
[`discord.py`]({{ dpydocs }})

Whether you're getting into Discord bots from scratch, or rewriting your bot from another library, this guide will
fulfil and teach concepts such as:

-   How to get started on working with bots;
-   How to create and organize commands;
-   Working with databases (such as [`sqlite`][sqlite-docs] and [`mongodb (pymongo)`][mongodb-docs]);
-   Using the [`AutoShardedClient`]({{ disnakedocs }}/api.html#disnake.AutoShardedClient) class to shard our bot;
-   A plethora of examples with popular topics along with in-depth explanation, and much more!
