# Command handling

Unless your bot project is a small one, it's a good idea to organize your bot's collection of commands and listeners into separate classes. [**Cogs**]({{ disnakedocs }}/ext/commands/cogs.html) help you to do just that!

!!! Note

    Cogs are typically used alongside with **Extensions**. You can read more about them [in the documentation]({{ disnakedocs }}/ext/commands/extensions.html). 

## Syntax changes

Cogs represent a fairly drastic change in the way you write commands and bots, so here's a list you can come back to for the primary syntax used in cogs:

- Each cog is a Python class that subclasses [`commands.Cog`]({{ disnakedocs }}/ext/commands/api.html#disnake.ext.commands.Cog).
- Decorators for commands in cogs:
    - Command - [`commands.command()`]({{ disnakedocs }}/ext/commands/api.html#disnake.ext.commands.command)
    - Slash command - [`commands.slash_command()`]({{ disnakedocs }}/ext/commands/api.html#disnake.ext.commands.slash_command)
    - User command - [`commands.user_command()`]({{ disnakedocs }}/ext/commands/api.html#disnake.ext.commands.user_command)
    - Message command - [`commands.message_command()`]({{ disnakedocs }}/ext/commands/api.html#disnake.ext.commands.message_command)
- Every listener is marked with the [`commands.Cog.listener()`]({{ disnakedocs }}/ext/commands/api.html#disnake.ext.commands.Cog.listener) decorator.
- Cogs are then registered with the [`Bot.add_cog()`]({{ disnakedocs }}/ext/commands/api.html#disnake.ext.commands.Bot.add_cog) call, and are subsequently removed with the [`Bot.remove_cog()`]({{ disnakedocs }}/ext/commands/api.html#disnake.ext.commands.Bot.remove_cog) call.
